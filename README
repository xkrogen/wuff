To run tests for the Rails server: simply run rspec from within the wuff_backend folder, 
which is where the Rails server is located. Note that the auth_facebook test may fail;
this is normal, as currently you must manually create a token from facebook which is
only valid for one hour. Functional tests can be run by running testLib.py within functional_tests folder,
but it is configured to access the heroku server and the server's database must be manually cleared 
beforehand so this is not recommended. 

You can start the server as you would any other rails server from within the wuff_backend folder.

To use the iOS application: Open the .xcworkspace file within the wuff_frontend folder. The
application can then be run from the simulator.
